# avrotize-rs

Rust port of [avrotize](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/avrotize), a tool to convert [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) into [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) schemas.

## âœ¨ Overview

`avrotize-rs` is a high-performance converter that reads JSON Schema documents and produces equivalent Avro schema files.
It aims to be feature-complete with the original Python [avrotize](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/avrotize), while leveraging Rustâ€™s speed, memory safety, and ecosystem.

Supported features include:

* âœ… Object â†’ Avro `record`
* âœ… Arrays â†’ Avro `array`
* âœ… `$defs` and `$ref` resolution
* âœ… Enums (`enum`) and constants (`const`)
* âœ… Required vs optional â†’ nullable unions in Avro
* âœ… Descriptions â†’ Avro `doc` fields
* âœ… Maps (`additionalProperties`)
* â¬œ Composition (`oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`) (partial support)

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Convert a JSON Schema file to Avro:

```bash
cargo run -F cli
Usage: jsonschema2avro <JSONSCHEMA> <AVRO>
```

## ðŸ§ª Tests

Fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/jsonschema/`.

For each fixture, an Avro schema is generated into `tests/fixtures/avro/` and compared against a snapshot in `tests/snapshots/`.

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap

* [ ] Full support for `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`
* [ ] More robust external `$ref` resolution
* [ ] Additional Avro features (fixed, logical types)
* [ ] Auto-discovery of fixture tests
